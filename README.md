Simple analysis tallying FEMA disaster declaration across the U.S. Later used to map in Tableau.

This project was a freelance piece published in the Courier-Journal in conjunction with the Mississippi River Basin Ag & Water Desk. For a story about increased flood events in Kentucky and throughout the Basin, I used data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to count the number of times each year a flood event was declared a disaster by the agency in a given area. This allowed us to identify specific counties that have been hardest hit by extreme flooding, and track an increase in flood events over time as climate change worsens. 

Data was taken from Open FEMA Datasets; Disaster Declaration Summaries: https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/disaster-declarations-summaries-v2

I also used a previously created CSV logging all U.S. counties and their FIPS codes to join to the FEMA data, to more easily identify the location of certain flood disaster events.
